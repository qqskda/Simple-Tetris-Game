__Project Purpose__:
  * Familiarize with basic Win32 API and CPP
  * Have a hands-on experience through designing and constructing a basic CPP program.
  * Practice code review while shadowing the above link; seeking for improvements in program efficiency, design, structure and features.
  
__Project Expectation__:
  * Have neat code, good documentation, and properly modularized structure.
  
__Outcome__:
  * Modularized the original code into several classes for the future scalability and maintainability.
  * Improved the original code in overall including fixing its errors/bugs.
  * Brief knowledge how WIN32 API works.
  
__Implementation__:
  * Added Shadow features; allow players to estimate where the block will be located once used hardDrop() function.
  * Added Restart and Exit function.

Following features are not implemented as it is out of project scope.

__Future Improvements__:
  * Due to the original code's implementation, there is a bit of delay between shadow and the actual code block when move() function triggered.
  * Current version does not support Tetris features such as a change in the speed of block drops, scoreboard, and sound effects.

__Lesson Learned__:
 * Importance of variable names, documentation, and modularization.
 * How a text-based game works.
 * How to create a simple window application.

__Future Study__:
 * Need more understandings in CPP.
 * Need more study in using pointer and reference efficiently via situations.
 * How to efficiently modularize the system structure for its future scalability and maintainability.
